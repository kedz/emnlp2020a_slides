\section{Conclusion}

\begin{frame}{Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
\item Can you make an arbitrary sequence2sequence model controllable? 
    \\ \uncover<2->{\textbf{To some degree, Yes!}}

    \begin{itemize}
\item Are there differences between recurrent models or
    transformers? \\ \uncover<3->{\textbf{Recurrent models fair better in smaller data settings.}}
\item What about large pretrained models? \\ \uncover<4->{\textbf{These work great and you should use them when dataset is small.}}
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
\item How systematic is a controllable sequence2sequence model? \\
    \uncover<2->{\textbf{In the large data setting, pretty well!}}\\
    \uncover<3->{\textbf{In the small data setting, error increases on arbitrary plans.}}\\
    \uncover<4->{\textbf{The best bet is to fine-tune a large, pretrained LM.}}\\
\item Can we improve systematicity with data-augmentation?\\
    \uncover<5->{\textbf{Yes, but only really reliably on a large data setting, where we don't need to do it :( }}
\end{itemize}
